# LinkedArray

Linked Lists simplified. Usage nearly same as arrays.\
Using this library, you can use Linked Lists nearly same as arrays and quick sort, merge sort, linear search and binary search.
It has a usage nearly same with arrays and contains some sort and search algorithms like merge sort, binary search etc.

## Made with Typescript

You can both use it in browser-side JavaScript or Node.js. Only thing you need is to change to "module" in tsconfig.json.\
If you set the "module" as "commonjs" it will be compiled for Node.js. Else if you set it as "es2015" or a higher ECMAScript version, it will compile it for browser-side JavaScript.

## Contribute

If you know algorithms and data structures, you can fork, develop and submit a pull request.\
If you know a bit algos&data structs, I bet you know better than me. I am making this project to improve myself a bit on algos&data structs. So please, contribute.
