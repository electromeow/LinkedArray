# LinkedArray

Linked Lists simplified. It's in development now.\
It will have a usage nearly same with arrays and will contain some sort and search algorithms like merge sort, binary search etc. The blank algorithms.ts file is for that. I will add some search&sort algorithms in it. When it is finished, a Python implementation will begin to been developing.

## Made with Typescript

You can both use it in browser-side JavaScript or Node.js. Only thing you need is to change to "module" in tsconfig.json.\
If you set the "module" as "commonjs" it will be compiled for Node.js. Else if you set it as "es2015" or a higher ECMAScript version, it will compile it for browser-side JavaScript.

## Contribute

If you know algorithms and data structures, you can fork, develop and submit a pull request.\
If you know a bit algos&data structs, I bet you know better than me. I am making this project to improve myself a bit on algos&data structs. So please, contribute.
